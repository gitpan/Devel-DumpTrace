Revision history for Devel-DumpTrace

0.09    2011-02-16
        Defer output of statements containing function calls until after the
	    function call completes.
        Refresh pads to evaluate lexical where assignment and declaration are
            in the same statement. That is, we now get  my $x=7 --> my $x:7=7
            and not my $x=7 --> my $x:undef=7.
        Implemented special handling of C-style for loops, while/until loops,
            if/elsif/else statements to show expressions that were implicitly
            evaluated between potential breakpoints in the trace output.
        Include subroutine name in trace output.

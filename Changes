Revision history for Devel-DumpTrace

0.12    2011-03-22
	Support for DUMPTRACE_PID and DUMPTRACE_TIME env var.
	Support for DUMPTRACE_FH=tty.
	Support for DUMPTRACE=a=b,c=d,... as shorthand for 
	    DUMPTRACE_a=b,DUMPTRACE_c=d
	Fix inappropriate implicit $_ on barewords that resemble builtin names.
	Fix deferred evaluation of complex lvalues.

0.11    2011-02-25
	Support to include/exclude packages at import. This also fixes the
	    uninitialized hash warning with v<=5.8.

0.10    2011-02-18
	Implemented decorator (see 0.09) for for[each] LIST construction.
	Implemented decorator for do-while and do-until constructions.
	Fixed PPI parsing to treat source code specified from -e, eval, or
	    standard input the same as code from a file.
	Fixed bug about inappropriate implicit $_ inserted after builtins.

0.09    2011-02-16
	Defer output of statements containing function calls until after the
	    function call completes.
	Refresh pads to evaluate lexical where assignment and declaration are
	    in the same statement. That is, we now get  my $x=7 --> my $x:7=7
	    and not my $x=7 --> my $x:undef=7.
	Implemented "decorators" for C-style for loops, while/until loops,
	    if/elsif/else statements to show expressions that were implicitly
	    evaluated between potential breakpoints in the trace output.
	Include subroutine name in trace output.

0.08    2011-02-10
